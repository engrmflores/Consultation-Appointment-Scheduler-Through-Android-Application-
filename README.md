# Optical Differential Diagnosis Process using Image Analysis

The human eye is a crucial component of our visual system, and regular eye exams are essential for maintaining good
eye health. However, these exams can be time-consuming and expensive, mainly when performed by an ophthalmologist. 

A study proposes the development of an improved eye examination device that utilizes image processing and analysis technology to
address this issue. 

The device employs the optical differential diagnosis process to provide a faster and more accurate evaluation of five commonly known eye diseases and assess healthy eyes.
During the exam, the device takes and analyzes images to detect the presence of any disease or abnormalities, which reduces the time required to deliver results and provides a more convenient
and cost-effective way to monitor and maintain eye health. 

After conducting several tests, the researchers found that the eye examination device had an overall accuracy of 92.49%.

Capturing Eye Image:

The device takes a picture of an eye, which is
subsequently processed using TensorFlow and CNN
algorithms. While processing the image, the system notes
certain features of the picture.

Optical Differential Diagnosis Result:

If any specific features are detected
that correspond to any of the defined eye diseases, the system
returns a list of possible eye diseases, which the symptoms
evaluator then narrows down and evaluates. After that, the
method returns the specified eye disease and its accuracy rate.
The image indicates healthy eyes if the system finds no traits
that could be attributed to any of the listed eye disorders.

This study created a system that utilizes the Optical
Differential Diagnosis Process and images analysis to diagnose
several eye diseases. Using a macro-lens camera, the
researchers obtained more detailed images of patients' eyes for
training and utilization of the system.
